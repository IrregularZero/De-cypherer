This weekend while I was reading encription topic in sololearn I was highly interested in cyphers, 
that's why I created this pretty simple program.

I tried to divide everything by functions to keep the code simple and readable.
At the first region, "Interactive menu", I used my template which creates menu with which you can interact by pressing buttons.

Time spent: ~5h
P.s. - I have lack of practice so that's why it took me that long, but I am still studing
